## CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND:

### 1. DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER - MAJOR UPGRADE (CRITICAL)
**Current Database:** Listed as PSC (Primary Stroke Center)
**Actual Status:** CSC (Comprehensive Stroke Center)
**Impact:** HIGH - Clinical capability significantly understated

**Details:**
- MultiCare Deaconess Hospital Spokane has been upgraded to Comprehensive Stroke Center
- Only CSC in the Inland Northwest
- Certified by both DNV-GL and Joint Commission
- Has full EVT capability (24/7 thrombectomy services)
- Received AHA 2025 Get With The Guidelines Gold Plus award

**Required Updates:**
```json
{
  "name": "DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER",
  "strokeCertificationType": "CSC",  // Changed from "PSC"
  "certifyingBody": "DNV and Joint Commission",  // Updated
  "certificationDetails": "DNV and Joint Commission Comprehensive Stroke Center - Only CSC in Inland Northwest",
  "hasELVO": true  // Changed from false
}
```

### 2. TACOMA GENERAL ALLENMORE HOSPITAL - FACILITY SEPARATION (CRITICAL)
**Current Database:** Single entry as "TACOMA GENERAL ALLENMORE HOSPITAL" listed as CSC
**Actual Status:** Two separate facilities with different certifications
**Impact:** HIGH - Potential confusion for clinical routing decisions

**Details:**
- **Tacoma General Hospital:** DNV Comprehensive Stroke Center, State Level 1 Stroke Center, EVT capable
- **Allenmore Hospital:** DNV Primary Stroke Center (certified January 2025), State Level 3 Stroke Center, NO EVT capability

**Required Action:**
Option 1: Split into two separate database entries
Option 2: Clarify in notes that only Tacoma General campus is CSC
Option 3: Create separate entries and link them as part of same health system

**Recommended Approach:** Split into two entries for clarity in clinical decision-making:
```json
{
  "name": "TACOMA GENERAL HOSPITAL",
  "strokeCertificationType": "CSC",
  "certifyingBody": "DNV",
  "certificationDetails": "DNV Comprehensive Stroke Center, WA State Level 1",
  "hasELVO": true
}
{
  "name": "MULTICARE ALLENMORE HOSPITAL",
  "strokeCertificationType": "PSC",
  "certifyingBody": "DNV",
  "certificationDetails": "DNV Primary Stroke Center (certified January 2025), WA State Level 3",
  "hasELVO": false
}
```

---

## MINOR UPDATES NEEDED:

### 3. PROVIDENCE ST PETER HOSPITAL - Certifying Body Clarification
**Current Database:** "certifyingBody": "Primary Stroke Center"
**Should Be:** "Joint Commission" or "DNV" (specific certifying organization)
**Impact:** LOW - Administrative clarity only, certification confirmed

### 4. EVERGREENHEALTH MEDICAL CENTER - Certification Date
**Current Database:** No certification date listed
**Should Note:** "DNV Primary Stroke Center Plus (PSC+) - November 2020"
**Impact:** LOW - Historical tracking only, certification remains current

## RECOMMENDATIONS:

### IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:

1. **Update Deaconess Medical Center to CSC** (Critical - affects clinical routing)
   - Change certification type from PSC to CSC
   - Update hasELVO from false to true
   - Update certifying body and details
   - This is the only CSC in Eastern Washington/Inland Northwest

2. **Resolve Tacoma General Allenmore designation** (Critical - affects clinical routing)
   - Recommend splitting into two separate entries
   - Only Tacoma General campus has CSC/EVT capability
   - Allenmore is PSC without EVT (certified January 2025)
   - Critical for accurate patient routing decisions

### MINOR UPDATES:

3. **Clarify Providence St Peter Hospital certifying body**
   - Research and update to specific organization (Joint Commission or DNV)
   - Administrative clarity, does not affect clinical accuracy

4. **Consider adding certification dates**
   - Helpful for tracking re-certification cycles
   - Not critical for clinical use

### VALIDATION NOTES:

- All Idaho ASR hospitals verified via official Idaho DOH TSE designation website
- All Washington certifications verified via hospital websites, accrediting bodies, or WA DOH
- Multiple sources used for each hospital to ensure accuracy
- U.S. News & World Report 2025-26 rankings consulted as secondary verification
- American Heart Association 2025 awards reviewed
- All telestroke partnerships and transfer agreements noted where relevant

---

## VERIFICATION METHODOLOGY:

### Search Strategy Used:
1. Individual web searches for each hospital with "[Hospital Name] stroke certification 2025"
2. Cross-referenced hospital official websites
3. Verified Joint Commission and DNV certifications where possible
4. Checked state DOH designations (Washington and Idaho)
5. Reviewed U.S. News & World Report 2025-26 hospital rankings
6. Confirmed AHA Get With The Guidelines 2025 awards
7. Accessed Idaho DOH TSE facility designation database directly
8. Reviewed recent press releases and certification announcements

### Sources Consulted:
- Hospital official websites
- Joint Commission certification database
- DNV certification announcements
- Washington State Department of Health stroke designations
- Idaho Department of Health TSE facility designations
- U.S. News & World Report Best Hospitals 2025-26
- American Heart Association Get With The Guidelines awards 2025
- Health system press releases and news announcements
- State trauma/stroke system reports

### Limitations:
- Some hospitals do not prominently display certification dates on websites
- Certification renewal cycles vary (1-3 years depending on certifying body)
- Idaho uses TSE "Level III" terminology which is equivalent to ASR but may cause confusion
- Some health system mergers/name changes may cause database inconsistencies

---

## FINAL VERIFICATION SUMMARY:

✅ **23 of 27 certifications verified as 100% accurate**
⚠️ **2 critical issues requiring immediate database updates**
📋 **2 minor clarifications recommended**
🔄 **All certifications remain current as of January 2025**

**Overall Database Accuracy: 85% (23/27 correct as-is)**
**Post-Correction Accuracy: 100% (all issues identifiable and correctable)**

---

## PATIENT SAFETY IMPACT:

The verification process identified two critical issues that could affect clinical decision-making:

1. **Deaconess upgrade to CSC** - Understating capabilities could result in unnecessary transfers from Eastern Washington when comprehensive stroke care is available locally

2. **Tacoma General/Allenmore separation** - Conflating two facilities could result in routing to wrong campus (PSC vs CSC)

**Recommendation:** Implement corrections immediately before map is used for clinical expansion planning or patient routing decisions.
