## CRITICAL CORRECTIONS APPLIED

### ⭐ ISSUE #1: DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER - UPGRADED TO CSC
**Impact:** HIGH - Only Comprehensive Stroke Center in Inland Northwest

**Correction:**
- Changed from PSC → **CSC**
- Added **24/7 EVT capability**
- Updated certifying body to **DNV and Joint Commission**
- Critical for Eastern Washington clinical routing

**Clinical Significance:**
- Eastern Washington previously had NO CSC (nearest was Seattle, 280 miles)
- Spokane region now has CSC capability
- Reduces unnecessary long-distance transfers
- Major improvement for stroke care access in rural Eastern WA

### ⭐ ISSUE #2: TACOMA GENERAL / ALLENMORE - SPLIT INTO TWO FACILITIES
**Impact:** HIGH - Prevents EVT routing confusion

**Correction:**
- Separated into **2 distinct facilities:**
  1. **TACOMA GENERAL HOSPITAL** - CSC, EVT capable, Level 1
  2. **MULTICARE ALLENMORE HOSPITAL** - PSC, NO EVT, Level 3 (certified January 2025)

**Clinical Significance:**
- Prevents routing EVT-eligible patients to wrong campus
- Only Tacoma General has CSC/EVT capability
- Critical for accurate emergency routing

### ✅ MINOR CORRECTIONS:
- **Providence St Peter Hospital** - Clarified certifying body (Joint Commission)
- **Data sources disclaimer** - Removed from right panel as requested
