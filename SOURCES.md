## TERMINOLOGY CLARIFICATION

### National Certifications (Voluntary):
- **ASRH/ASR:** Acute Stroke Ready (Hospital) - TJC uses "ASRH", DNV uses "ASR"
- **PSC:** Primary Stroke Center - Universal across all certifying bodies
- **TSC/PSC+:** Thrombectomy-Capable Stroke Center (TJC) = Primary Plus (DNV)
- **CSC:** Comprehensive Stroke Center - Universal across all certifying bodies

### State Designations (Regulatory):
- **Washington State:** Uses Level I, II, III categorization
- **Separate from national certifications:** Hospitals may have both
- **Hybrid Model:** WA is one of 6 states using this approach

### Capabilities (Not Certifications):
- **EVT (Endovascular Thrombectomy):** Clinical capability, not a certification level
- **24/7 Thrombectomy:** Descriptor for TSC and CSC facilities
- **Telestroke:** Service capability, separate from certification

---

## CONFIDENCE LEVELS

### ✅ HIGH CONFIDENCE (Multiple Official Sources):
- Four national certifying bodies exist
- Four certification levels (ASRH/ASR, PSC, TSC/PSC+, CSC)
- DNV uses "Primary Plus (PSC+)" for TSC equivalent
- Joint Commission physician volume requirements (15/12mo or 30/24mo)
- 2025 standards release dates confirmed
- Washington State uses separate Level I, II, III system

### ⚠️  MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (Single Official Source or Academic):
- Specific Washington State Level I, II, III criteria details (application documents not fully accessible)
- ACHC and CIHQ specific program details (less publicly available than TJC/DNV)

### ❓ LOWER CONFIDENCE (Requires Direct Verification):
- Exact alignment between WA State levels and national certification equivalents
- Complete procedural volume requirements for Washington State designations
